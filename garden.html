			<p>A scientist by day and an amature at whatever I can get my hands on by night, I spend much of my free time working on another project close to my heart, my garden.
			After purchasing a home, my husband and I were stunned to find that almost every plant in the garden was considered to be invasive in the state of Indiana.  My latest 
			project has been removing four honeysuckle vines, three honeysuckle bushes, two white mulberry trees, one jetbead bush (Rhodotypos scandens), two callery pears, and quite a few 
			weedy rose of sharon shrubs. I have been captivated by the idea that we can create wildlife oases to connect natural habitats for local critters. I am working on slowly replacing 
			these plants with ecologically relevant species that will provide needed habitat for our local wildlife populations. I have had some success at attracting monarchs last year after 
			replacing a honeysuckle beds with milkweed (Asclepias incarnata). Within a few weeks a monarch caterpillar had appeared and I have been fortunate to spy whats left of a few chrysalis after the monarch emerges. </p>
