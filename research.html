		<h4> Social isolation and serotonergic modulation</h4>
		<div class= "row">
			<div class= 12 columns>
				<p>
				I am studying social context and the modulatory effects of serotonin on auditory processing in mice. In this project, we are interested in how  internal state (in this case, a period of social isolation after weaning) affects the activity of neurons in the IC, a region of the auditory system that integrates sensory information and receives seroternergic innervation from the dorsal rafae nucleus, in response to courtship calls (pictured below).</br>
				Contribution: I assessed  the density of c-fos immunoreactive neurons (a widely accepted marker of neuronal activation) in the IC after pharmacologically manipulating serotonin systemically in mice that had experienced either chronic social isolation or had been socially housed. This project was my first go at planning and running an experiment. While it was designed and assigned to me by my supervisor, I had the autonomy to plan, execute, and clollect/alyze data. I learned a lot about  the logistical details that go into planning an experiment and gained experience with the process of writing up technicial detials, creating figures, and submitting for publication. </br>

				 Previous studies  in the lab have used slow-scan voltammetry to look at the real-time oxidation of serotonin in IC of mice in a same-sex interaction. This technique has allowed for the collection of information relating to serotonin release in the IC of awake mice that have been presented with salient stimuli. I was able to spend some time learning about this technique  upon my arrival, however, the equiptment needed a tune-up. This allowed me to learn about the machine in-depth in order to troubleshoot the equiptment. In the meantime, I was given a project to use immunohistochemistry to look at the activation of seroternergic cells in regions of the dorsal raphae nucleus that project to the inferior colliculus after an opposite sex interaction. This will provide insight into not only the impact of internal state on neuronal populations in the IC to salient stimuli but into the mechanisms  of serotonergic cells that are modulating that response. This paper is still in progress. </br>
				 </br>
				 One of my favorite parts of my job is that I'm able to utalize creative problem solving skills. I get to seek out and try new analysis programs to expediate and automate data analysis. I get to write up laboratoy protocals and create checklists for laboratory techniques and I get to troubleshoot equiptment in the lab and build new equiptment in the lab. I recently designed and asembeled a social isolation chamber based on those available comercially saving our lab over $1,000. </br>

		<div class= "row">
		<div class= "six columns">
		
		<p> Prior to this, I worked in a translational physiology lab that uses ossabaw pigs as a model organism to study coronary artery disease and diabeties due to their thrifty genotype. When fed a high fat-high sugar diet, the lab was able to 
		investigate the development of metabolic syndrome and calcium signaling anomalies within smooth coronary muscle cells associated with the development of ahtrosclerosis. As a laboratoy technician in the Sturek lab, I assisted with 
		procedures and surgeries including cath labs, stent placement, and blood glucose tests. In terms of  <i>in vitro</i> work, I analyzed tissues, cell cultures, and organ cultures using microscopy and calcium imaging. </br>

		<h4>Biocompatability of Thick-Film Ceramic Electrodes </h4>
		<p>My first research experience was my master's thesis titled,<i> In Vitro Biocompatibility of HTCC Thick-Film Electrodes for Use in Neural Implantable Devices</i>. This was a small part of a larger study with the ultimate goal 
		of creating a hermetically sealed package for electrodes to be implanted onto peripherial nerves. In this project, I built ceramic high temperature co-fired (HTTCC) thick-film micro-electrodes and used Immunofluorescence 
		microscopy and cell culture techniques to look at the survivability of a neuronal-like PC-12 cell line,  a schwann cell line, and rat dorsal root glial cells on these electrodes under passive conditions and under electrical stimulation.
		The findings were presented at the 10th World Biomaterials Congress in 2016 by Dr. Henry Lancashire. To read more 
		about this, check out the <a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/10.3389/conf.FBIOE.2016.01.01804/event_abstract">abstract</a> for the event.
