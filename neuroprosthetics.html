			<p> Starting at Indiana University as a first-generation college student was confusing to say the least. It was easy to get swept away with the current and it was a constant challenge to find direction. While this independence caused some apprehension, I also deeply valued the privilege to explore my intellectual interests and direct my life's path. I have also always valued my ability to express myself through movement whether that was dance, martial arts, color guard, or jogging. In my first two years of undergrad, I changed majors multiple times from occupational therapy, to dance kinesiology, to various scientific disciplines. I even considered pre-med and pre-physical therapy tracks. I've since realized that what I was trying to achieve with my professional self was to end up in a career where I could use my scientific inclination to help others by sharing the gift of bodily autonomy, expression through movement, and independence that I so deeply valued. The problem is, this is vague and is more of an intention than a plan. Academically, it was obvious that I was inclined toward my science classes, but I wasn't yet aware of graduate school as an option nor how one might go about choosing a career as a researcher. It wasn't until my senior year during an neuroscience course when I was shown a video of work being done at BrainGate to create prosthetic limbs, controlled through a brain machine interface, for use by people with a loss of motor or sensory function. At the same time, in my human biology capstone course, we were assigned several projects that required us to seek out primary research articles. The combination of these two experiences was an awaking of sorts and graduate school was finally on my radar. I was moved by its potential to impact the lives of real people and inspired by the idea that I could use my newfound aptitude in science to share my love of movement in ways that had only just been dreamed of and I wanted in! With my new goal in hand, the next step seemed obvious, I needed a deeper understanding of neuroscience. Unfortunately, I hadn't yet had the opportunity to learn about academic research and had been told by a professor that it was unlikely that I'd be accepted into a neuroscience program with a biology degree. During an uncharacteristically obstinate summer, I took a chance and applied to five master's in neuroscience programs in the United Kingdom. I was shocked to receive acceptance letters from all five universities and attended the most exciting program available, a master's program in neuroscience at University College London. Here I worked on a project testing the cytotoxicity of thick-film micro-electrode arrays which were to eventually be used with devices implanted onto peripheral neurons.
